#Installing SteamVR 

Once you have installed Steam, the next step is to install [SteamVR](https://www.steamvr.com/en/)


Make sure you have an up-to-date NVIDIA driver (on 20th Feb 2020, we had NVIDIA driver version 430.64 installed on our Ubuntu 16.04). We installed the driver via xx.run file we obtained from the NVIDIA website. You will need to make sure it also installs 32-bit GL libraries, so click on Yes when it prompts during the installation process.
